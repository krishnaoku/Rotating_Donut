This is the overview of the mathematical explanation for the spinning doughnut.


* The sin() and the cos() are the only trignometric functions present in this code.

*'sini' and 'cosi' are the sin and the cos values of the angle 'i'. The bounds of this angle are 0 to 6.28 (which is 2Ï€), one full circle.

*'sinj' and 'cosj' also follow the same as above.

*Angle 'j' is the vertical postion of the points on the grid and is incremented by 0.02. Angle 'i' is the horizontal positioning, and is incremented by 0.07. 

*'sinA' and 'cosA' represent the sin and the cos values of the rotating angle 'A'. Angle 'A' changes over time, contributing to the rotation.

*'sinB' and 'cosB' also follow the same as angle A.

*Angle 'A' is the rotation around x-axis and is incremented by 0.04. Angle 'B' corresponds to the y-axis rotation and is incremented by 0.02.


All of these elements combine together to graph and rotate this magical donut.
